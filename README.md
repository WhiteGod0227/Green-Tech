## 🧭 Overview

**Green Tech** is an innovative, IoT-based *Smart Waste Collection Routing System* that revolutionizes urban waste management through **data analytics** and **AI-powered route optimization**.  
It minimizes fuel use, reduces overflow problems, and ensures cleaner, more sustainable cities — aligning perfectly with modern *Smart City* initiatives.

---

## 💡 Core Concept

Smart bins embedded with IoT sensors continuously monitor fill levels and send data to a central web dashboard.  
The system uses an **AI route optimization algorithm** to calculate the most efficient collection paths, ensuring waste is collected *only when necessary* — saving **time, fuel, and effort.**

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture

### 🗑 1. Smart Bins (IoT Layer)
- Ultrasonic sensors to measure bin fill levels.
- Data sent wirelessly (via Wi-Fi, LoRa, or GSM) to the server.
- Each bin has a unique ID and geolocation tag.

### 💻 2. Web Dashboard (Frontend Interface)
- Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Tailwind CSS)**.
- Displays live bin status, location, and fill-levels on an **interactive map**.
- Includes sections:
  - 🏠 *Home* — System overview and quick stats  
  - 🌍 *About* — Vision and goals  
  - 📊 *Dashboard* — Real-time monitoring  
  - ✉️ *Contact* — Reach out and feedback  

### 🧠 3. AI Route Optimization (Backend Logic)
- Uses data analytics to decide which bins need collection.
- Calculates optimized routes considering:
  - Bin fill-levels
  - Truck capacity
  - Distance matrix (using Google Maps API)
- Output: shortest, most fuel-efficient route.
